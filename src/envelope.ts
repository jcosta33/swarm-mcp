//   2. `data` is the CLI's `--json` output VERBATIM — including the CLI's own honest fields (a check's
//      `level`/`verdict` outcome, the human-recorded board `reviewStatus`). suspec-mcp passes the human's
//      recorded state through; it does not scrub it and does not adjudicate it.
// The `derived.humanAttention` list is computed BY suspec-mcp from the real ReviewReport facts, labelled
// as derived so no one mistakes it for an engine field (the engine emits facts + an advisory level only).
// Each item is STRUCTURED `{category, severity, message, ref}` (AC-010) so an agent can act selectively
// without re-parsing `data`.
