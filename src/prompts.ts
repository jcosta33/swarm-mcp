// The v0 prompts — short, procedural templates that shape the agent toward calling the tools, never
// duplicating their logic. The before-done / review-assistant pair is deliberately ASYMMETRIC: it is
// the honesty lever for the "does arming the implementer with reconcile launder the gate?" tension —
// the implementer gets the facts to clean mechanical drift but is told it cannot sign off; the reviewer
// is told a clean reconcile is a starting point to falsify, not a result to trust. No prompt grants any
// verdict authority (ADR-0077 D8).
