// against the REAL `suspec` binary into a temp dir, then asserts the checked-in fixtures still match the
// freshly generated ones STRUCTURALLY (every key path identical). It is the wire that trips when a fixture
// is hand-edited or goes stale against the binary — the fixture's job is to be the binary's output, so a
// drift between "what's checked in" and "what the binary now emits" must fail here, loudly.
//
// The comparison normalizes the two volatile, environment-specific values the binary stamps — absolute
// filesystem paths (the temp workspace) and the review's content-addressed evidenceDigest (a hash of the
// generated diff/packet) — to a placeholder, so the test asserts the SHAPE + the stable values, not the
// machine it ran on. If the suspec binary is not present, the test is skipped (not failed): CI that lacks
// a sibling suspec-cli checkout cannot regenerate, and a false red there would be noise — but the skip is
// LOUD (a stderr warning names what was looked for), so a disarmed tripwire is visible, never silent.
