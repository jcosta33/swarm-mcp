// suspec-mcp's gate mirrors suspec-cli's rigor: near-100% coverage, enforced. statements/lines/functions
// sit at 100; branches at ~97.08 (as of the read+reconcile+safe-write surface). The thresholds (99/95/100/
// 99) sit a hair below so the gate has teeth — a regression that drops a tested path trips it — without
// being gamed up to a round 100. Branches is the tightest (95 vs ~97) precisely because that is where the
// remaining uncovered code lives; it is NOT a moat that would let a real tested branch be deleted unnoticed.
//
// The uncovered branches are I/O FALLBACKS + defensive null-coalesce arms, left uncovered deliberately
// (exercising them would need spawn-mocking or a timed signal-kill — coverage theatre, not signal), NOT
// untested behaviour. Line numbers drift with edits; the SHAPES are:
//   • src/suspec/invoke.ts — `caught instanceof Error ? … : String(caught)` (spawnSync throws only Error
//     subclasses, so the String() arm is a belt; the Error arm IS tested via the NUL-byte throw test), and
//     `result.status ?? 1` / `result.stdout ?? ''` / `result.stderr ?? ''`: under `encoding: 'utf8'` the
//     streams are always strings and a normally-exiting child carries a numeric status; status is null only
//     on a signal-kill (the 30s timeout), which we do not unit-time.
//   • src/slices.ts — the `as_obj(s) ?? {}` arms that sit AFTER a `.filter(... diagnostics.length > 0)` or
//     on a known-object element: the element is already a non-null object there, so the `?? {}` belt is
//     unreachable-in-practice defence (the fallback arms that ARE reachable — a non-object payload — are
//     covered by test/slices.spec.ts).
//   • src/roots.ts — the deepest-existing-ancestor realpath arms of confine_path (defensive against a
//     symlinked parent whose realpath differs; the escape cases ARE tested by the symlink-escape tests).
//   • src/resources.ts confine-null arm — marked `/* v8 ignore */` inline (is_safe_segment already gates).
// All of the security-critical paths (traversal, flag injection, verb + FLAG allow-list, no mutation flag)
// ARE covered; see test/roots.spec.ts, test/invoke.spec.ts, test/slices.spec.ts, and test/server.spec.ts.
